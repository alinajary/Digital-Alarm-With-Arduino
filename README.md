# Digital-Alarm-With-Arduino
This is a Digital Alarm with Arduino uno and DS1307 RTC module. you can easily edit this code as this is a modular code. DS1307 is a Real Time Clock(RTC), that is simple to use. The IC basically is able to count the date and time accurately and it will continue its counting if the backup battery – coin cell battery is there although the mainsupply to the IC is cut off.

The hardware that you need for this are :

- DS 1307
- 32.768kHz Quartz Crystal X 1
- Coin cell CR2032 & the holder
- 10k resistor x 2
- LCD board x 1
- Arduino uno x 1

I used RTClib for this program. This library is easy to use and able to get the date, time and day of the week accurately. here is some pictures about this project:
